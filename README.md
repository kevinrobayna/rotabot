SlackApp that makes team rotations easy

## Development

[Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install), you can do this with Brew or your favourite way of installing dependencies.

* Install dependencies like this: `make install`
* Run Tests: `make test`
* Compile the app like this: `make build`
* Run the app: `make dev`
    * This would use something called reflex and reload the app continuously when you change a go file.
* Check your linting by running `make lint`
